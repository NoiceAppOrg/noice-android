## Get the app
Get Noice in the [Google Play Store][2].

## Infrastructure
* **Views**: The app is a single fragment that loads a video and has a few buttons for interactions.  
* **Network**: [Parse](https://parse.com/) is used for network requests and no local data is stored.  
* **Video Playback**: The [YouTube Android Player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/android/player/) is used for easy video playback

## Setup
To run the app locally, you will need to:
* Setup a [Parse](https://parse.com/) account to get an application id and client key
* Follow the instructions in the [YouTube Android Player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/android/player/) to get a Google Developer Console API key
